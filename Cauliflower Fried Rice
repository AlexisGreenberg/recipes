Next add cherry tomatoes and frozen peas and stir-fry for further 2 minutes.
Pour the beaten eggs over the veggies and spread around so all the veg is covered. Don’t stir though, just spread gently around. After half a minute or so mix the eggs to create a scrambled texture.
Add the cauliflower to the wok and fry for another 4 minutes or until the cauliflower is cooked and soft.
Season with salt and freshly ground pepper and tamari sauce if using it.
